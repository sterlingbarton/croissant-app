        <h3>About</h3>
        <p class="info">
          <strong>Pit bull</strong> is a term used in the United States for a
          type of dog descended from bulldogs and terriers, while in other
          countries such as the United Kingdom the term is used as an
          abbreviation of the American Pit Bull Terrier breed. The term was
          first used in 1927. Within the United States the pit bull is usually
          considered a heterogeneous grouping that includes the breeds American
          Pit Bull Terrier, American Staffordshire Terrier, American Bully,
          Staffordshire Bull Terrier and occasionally the American Bulldog,
          along with any crossbred dog that shares certain physical
          characteristics with these breeds, such as a square-shaped head or
          bulky body type. In other countries including Britain, the
          Staffordshire Bull Terrier is not considered a pit bull.

        <h3>Reputation</h3>
        <p class="info">
          Pit bull-type dogs have a controversial reputation as pets both in the
          United States and internationally, due to the fact that they are
          extensively used for dogfighting, a practice that has continued
          despite being outlawed. Proponents of the breed and advocates of
          regulation have engaged in a nature-versus-nurture debate over whether
          apparent aggressive tendencies in pit bulls may be appropriately
          attributed to owners' care for the dog or inherent qualities. Numerous
          advocacy organizations have sprung up in defense of the pit bull. A
          pro-pit bull lobby exists that spends millions of dollars a year
          promoting pit bulls as family pets, funding pro-pit bull researchers,
          and opposing laws that regulate their ownership.

        <h3>Personality</h3>
        <p class="info">
          Pit Bulls are smart, confident, good-natured companions and their
          courage is proverbial. A responsibly bred, well-socialized pit is a
          loyal, trustworthy friend to the end. Pit Bull owners describe their
          dogs as keenly aware of their surroundings, game for anything, and
          lovable 'personality dogs' around the house. They make excellent
          family companions and have always been noted for their love of
          children. This breed likes mental and physical challenges. They are
          highly trainable because of their high level of intelligence and
          willingness to work. Because some exhibit a level of dog aggression
          and because of its powerful physique, this breed requires an owner who
          will carefully socialize and obedience train the dog. A pit's natural
          agility makes it one of the most capable canine climbers so good
          fencing is a must. The Pit Bull is not the best choice for a guard dog
          since they are extremely friendly, even with strangers.
